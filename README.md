# FullStack Social Media App

A fullstack, responsive **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) social media application with user authentication, likes, dark mode, and a modern UI built with **Material UI** (MUI).

I've been building this project over the past week to deepen my understanding of the MERN stack and practice integrating fullstack features from scratch. It's been a great way to get hands-on with both frontend and backend development, and explore topics like token-based auth, dynamic theming, and RESTful API design.
